###### An electricity bill splitter

I made this on request and the concept is that you have a bill
to split among roommates, but the deal is that each roommate pays a
different share. The purpose of this script is to split the bill according
to the ratio each roommate must pay for the charges that this apply, but split
equally the charges for the power consumption.

###### Usage:

```python2 dei_split.py --help```
